## Creating incremental archives in Linux using scripts

There are two simple examples of creating an incremental archive of a usb flash
drive using bash and python scripts with mounting, if necessary, the target directory
with the archive.

Only standard libraries are used for the python script, but just in case, the files
are posted:
- requirements.txt (to create an environment on pip)
- requirements.yml (for conda)

> Reservation: the python script uses CLI commands,
> so it cannot be considered a true native 'python-script')
